    <h2>Archie's story</h2>
    <p>This is my dog, Archie. The biggest pain in the butt there is.</p>
    <p>Archie is an eight year old Boston Terrier that was rescued from a shelter by us.</p>
    <p>When he was brought to the shelter he was a stay, found on the streets of Oakland CA.</p>
    <p>Archie was ill at the time we rescued him and was only skin and bones.</p>
    <p>Today, seven years later, Archie is a healthy, happy memeber of the family.</p>
